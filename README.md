#Sublime Text 2 Quick File Move

A simple ST2 plugin to help you move or rename your files

## You don't need this plugin!

This functionality is available via the shortcut command "side\_bar\_move" in the [SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements) plugin.

You can put it in your User Key Bindings file like so:
  { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+r"], "command": "side\_bar\_move" }

###Usage

Press `ctrl+shift+r` then enter your new file path or filename!

###Configuring

Add `{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+r"], "command": "quick_file_move" }` to your user keybindings file and change
the keymap to whatever you prefer.

###Code

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wulftone/sublime-text-2-quick-file-move)!

Credit goes to [a.stenlund@gmail.com]() for making the
[first version](http://sublime-text-community-packages.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/QuickRename/) for ST1.
